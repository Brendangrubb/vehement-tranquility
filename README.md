## Description
**Vehement Tranquility** is an application that demonstrates our ability to build a project using the Drupal framework. We retain the site maintenance account and have created an admin account for the client, the band Vehement Tranquility. With their admin account they can post custom content such as tour dates, show photos, new music to stream, etc. Fans of the band can sign up for an authenticated user account which allows them to post comments on admin posts and gives them access to the fan forum. The anonymous user can view all band posts, comments and forum discussions but can not post.
